.Name & Return Address -> weight/ dimensions -> print label -> schedule pickup.

Requirements:
collection with userID to save personal details,
PDF and scheduled pickups numbers
(w/ ability to change them later).

radio input:

1. "Request free pickup from this address"
2. "I will drop off the package at the PO myself"

We would like to know the pickup address first.
According to it we calculate if it's located in the allowed zone.

What if address on the label and the pickup address are different?
I.e. location from where it's picked up doesn't match the price of the printed label.

What happens if the return address is invalid (is not supported for pickup), but the person agrees to bring it to post office himself?
